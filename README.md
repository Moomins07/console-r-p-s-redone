For Day 61 of my 100-days-of-code challenge, I returned to The Odin project curriculum and decided to re-do one of the coding/project challenges that required me to create a game of RPS in the console. A few days ago, I recently re-did that same project with a GUI, however, I wanted to re-create the console version with added functionality that included using newly learned concepts.
